* Threads and Locking *
-----------------------

The A1 library has been designed to be thread safe, when helper thread or interrupts are enabled or when the user has specified a 
A1_THREAD_MULTIPLE as the thread level. A global (DCMF) lock is acquired on entry into any of any A1D function. 
The lock is given up of exit of the function or when waiting on communication progress, thus allowing the helper 
thread (CHT) to acquire the lock and hit advance (DCMF_Messager_advance). When the helper thread is not present, 
the lock is retained and the main thread hits advance until the required communication progress is achieved.

None of the A1DI functions should acquire the lock since these functions are called from within the A1D functions or from inside 
a DCMF Callback at which point the lock would have already been acquired.
